### Changes Summary:
- **Removed Address Management:** Since you're managing digital game accounts rather than physical items, there's no need for address handling.
- **Removed Delivery and Pickup Options:** As there's no physical product to deliver or pick up, this feature is unnecessary.
- **Digital Inventory Management:** Focus on managing digital accounts, including tracking their availability and usage.

This streamlined approach focuses directly on the core aspects of your project, making it easier to manage and develop the essential features.
